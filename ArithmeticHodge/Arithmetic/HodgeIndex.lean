  LAYER 6: The Arithmetic Hodge Index Theorem

  THIS IS THE LEMMA. This is the summit of the formalization.

  Statement: The arithmetic intersection pairing on ĈH¹₀(Spec(ℤ̄))
  is negative-definite on the degree-zero subspace.

  Equivalently: for any metrized line bundle L̂ of arithmetic degree zero,
  the self-intersection L̂ · L̂ ≤ 0, with equality iff L̂ is torsion.

  This is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis.

  The chain of equivalences:
    Arithmetic Hodge Index ⟺ Weil positivity ⟺ RH

-- ============================================================

/-- A metrized line bundle on Spec(ℤ), in the Arakelov sense.

    Since Pic(ℤ) = 0 (ℤ is a PID), a line bundle on Spec(ℤ) is trivial.
    A metrized line bundle is therefore just the trivial bundle equipped
    with a Hermitian metric on its complexification, which is determined
    by a single positive real number (the norm of the generator 1).

    We represent this by the log of the metric. -/

/-- The Arakelov self-intersection pairing for Spec(ℤ).

    For Spec(ℤ), the Arakelov pairing of L̂ with itself is:
      L̂ · L̂ = -(logMetric)²

    This is always ≤ 0, so the Hodge Index Theorem is TRIVIALLY TRUE
    for Spec(ℤ) at this level (dimension 1). -/

-- The Full Arithmetic Hodge Index (Over ℤ̄ — THE SUMMIT)

/-- An element of the arithmetic Chow group ĈH¹₀(Spec(ℤ̄)).

    The full arithmetic Chow group over the algebraic closure ℤ̄ is
    the colimit of ĈH¹(Spec(𝒪_K)) over all number fields K/ℚ.
    Elements are equivalence classes of metrized divisors of degree zero.

    We model this abstractly as a type equipped with
    a symmetric bilinear pairing. -/

    SORRY REASON: Requires full Arakelov intersection theory:

    - Green's functions on Riemann surfaces
    - The height pairing on the arithmetic Chow group
    - Passage to the colimit over all K

    in any proof assistant).

-- THE ARITHMETIC HODGE INDEX THEOREM
-- ============================================================

/-- **THE ARITHMETIC HODGE INDEX THEOREM** (Conjectural — equivalent to RH)

    For any α ∈ ĈH¹₀(Spec(ℤ̄)), the self-intersection is non-positive:
      ⟨α, α⟩ ≤ 0
    with equality if and only if α is torsion.

    This is equivalent to RiemannHypothesis (as defined in Mathlib).

    THIS IS THE HARD SORRY. This sorry is equivalent to RH.
    All other sorry's in the project are either infrastructure
    (known mathematics awaiting formalization) or consequences of this one.

    SORRY REASON: Equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis.
    DIFFICULTY: Millennium Prize level.
    STRATEGIES:
      A (Connes): Trace formula on 𝔸_ℚ/ℚ* → Weil positivity
      B (Arakelov): Formal Hodge theory on arithmetic surfaces
      C (Detailed Balance): Product formula → unitarity → spectral positivity -/

/-- The Arithmetic Hodge Index implies RH (informal chain).
    This records the logical dependency:
    Hodge Index → Weil positivity → RH.

    SORRY REASON: Requires formalizing the equivalence between
    the Arakelov pairing and the Weil functional.
    DIFFICULTY: Substantial — requires Arakelov-to-Weil dictionary. -/
